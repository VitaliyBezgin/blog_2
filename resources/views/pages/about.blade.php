                A lot of people forget to properly formulate the purpose of their blog
                post or article. This is unfortunate, because if you do not properly
                define the aim of your text, it will be impossible to check whether or not
                you have succeeded. You do not write just for the sake of writing but
                because you have an idea of what you want your audience to know or do
                (or to stop doing).I previously wrote posts about the structure and about
